                <p>Stories connect the dots of our life and truly make us who we are. These true stories are just as incredible, beautiful, heartbreaking, and breathtaking as the fictional stories we watch on television and read in books. </p>

                <p>It’s a way to gather together and build deeper community and find greater commonality with friends, family, neighbors, and beyond.</p>

                <h4 class="sublead">Sharing</h4>
                <h6 class="subheader">What matters most</h6>

                <p>Life as We Know It is meant to be your gathering place—your front porch, hearth, kitchen table—where you gather to hear and be heard, to tell your stories. The pages in this book are yours to fill, to help you craft your story and share your life. Use the blank pages to write narrative, develop an outline, draw pictures, attach a photo or memorable item, sketch a timeline—the space is yours to be creative and let your stories speak.</p>

                <p>Use it in small groups, over coffee, in a Sunday school class, or over family dinner. Use it to get to know your coworkers, neighbors, or team. Use it to get to know your own story and how the dots of your life connect.</p>

                <p>There was a time when people gathered on front porches, by the hearth, around kitchen tables. Stories would be told, time and again, renewed with each telling. Somewhere along the way, we’ve lost that and with it the art of storytelling. Sharing stories is foundational to community and the meaningful relationships we all long for.</p>

                <p>Sharing our lives—our stories—is how we grow and build community. Life as We Know It is meant to facilitate meaningful sharing that is the foundation for the caring relationships we long for in this life.</p>

                <p>Our hope is that this experience will open your heart as your walls go down, helping you to see others—and yourself—in light of the stories that define us. Some stories might surprise you, some might move you, and some might even confront you. Through it all, Life as We Know It will challenge you to listen to and to share in the grand narrative of life, as we know it.</p>
